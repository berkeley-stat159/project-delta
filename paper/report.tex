\section{Introduction}

Identify a published fMRI paper and the accompanying data
\cite{lindquist2008statistical}.  You should explain the basic idea of the
paper in a paragraph.  You should also perform basic sanity check on the data
(e.g., can you downloaded, can you load the files, confirm that you have the
correct number of subjects).

Briefly explain what reproducibility means and in what sense you will
try to reproduce this study.
